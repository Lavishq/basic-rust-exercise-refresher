## rust exersize

 after reaching [this comprehensive rust problem](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/pattern-matching/exercise.html) i wasnt sure how to solve this so i searched yt for `rust comprehensive but found the 6h video by zero to mastery which i didnt watch but opened their exersize link form description and will just do exercises and maybe check solutions and then thats it

 might watch videos on exersizes for some advanced problmes (didnt need to since soln was code was in repo and explanation demo was present)

> i watched a couple topics after 3h mark -> derive, impl, strings, advanced match, etc etc.. meaning all the demos
